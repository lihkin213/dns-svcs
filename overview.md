# About {{site.data.keyword.dns_short}}
{: #about-dns-services}

To better understand {{site.data.keyword.dns_full}}, it helps to know more about DNS in general.
{:shortdesc}

## DNS overview
{: #dns-overview}

Computers on a network can find one another by IP addresses. To make it easier to work within a computer network such as the internet, people can use a Domain Name System (DNS) to associate human-friendly domain names with these addresses, similar to a phonebook. A DNS can also associate other information beyond just computer network addresses to domain names.

That way, people can use human friendly domain names instead of obscure, hard-to-remember, machine-oriented data.

## {{site.data.keyword.dns_short}}
{: dns-services-overview}

{{site.data.keyword.dns_short}} allow you to:
  * create DNS zones that are collections for holding domain names.
  * create DNS resource records under these zones.
  * specify access controls used for the DNS resolution of resource records on a zone-wide level.

{{site.data.keyword.dns_short}} also maintains its own world-wide set of DNS resolvers. Computer machines provisioned under {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} on an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network can use resource records configured through IBM Cloud DNS Services by querying {{site.data.keyword.dns_short}} resolvers.

Resource records and zones configured through {{site.data.keyword.dns_short}} are:
  * separated from the wider, public DNS and their publicly accessible records.
  * hidden from machines outside of and not part of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network.
  * accessible only from machines that you authorize on the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network.
  * resolvable only via the resolvers provided by the service.

{{site.data.keyword.dns_short}} ensures a level of privacy for information specified in your zones and resource records.

{{site.data.keyword.dns_short}} is private only. For provisioning and configuring DNS records for public DNS resolution, refer to [{{site.data.keyword.cis_full_notm}}](/docs/infrastructure/cis?topic=cis-about-ibm-cloud-internet-services-cis) ({{site.data.keyword.cis_short_notm}}).
